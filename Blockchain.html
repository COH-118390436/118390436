                    <ol>
                        <li>A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Due to its design, blockchain is resistant to retroactive of its records, as any changes made must be ratified by others in the peer-to-peer network.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>This openness combined with security makes it well suited for cryptocurrency,as it does not need a central authority to regulate it.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Examples of cryptocurrency are Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Blockchain is also being implemented in the Financial Services industry, such as distributed ledgers for banking use.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Walmart and IBM are partnering to implement blockchain to track and monitor Walmart's supply chain.</li>
