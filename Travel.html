            <h1>Travel</h1>
            <ol>
                <ul>I have always loved travelling since I was young lad.</ul>
                <br>
                <ul>My family and I go on holiday most summers.</ul>
                <br>
                <ul>We usually go to France or Spain, but we have gone to England the past couple of years.</ul>

            <h2>Spain</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>My first memory of going on holidays was to Barcelona, Spain when I was 5 years old with my family.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>We mostly stayed in Barcelona and Salou when we went to Spain, but one year, we went to the Basque country.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I have seen a couple of soccer games whilst there, primarily Espanyol FC games (as Barcelona FC games are very expensive).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Another attraction in Barcelona/Salou is the Portaventura entertainment park, which we visited every time we went to the area.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The Basque country was also very interesting to visit, as it very different culturally from the rest of Spain, much like Catalonia, where Barcelona is located.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I managed to get to an Athletic Bilbao match while there, which was very entertaining.</li>
                    <br>
                </ol>

            <h2>France</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>France was where my family and I went on holidays the most.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>We have been all around France, staying in a variety of caravan parks and camping sites.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I enjoyed these places the most, as I was given a lot of freedom of where I could go, that I didn't have at home.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>We also visited Paris, and Disneyland, a couple of times.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I enjoyed visiting French historical sites and museums immensely, especially Medieval sites, due to my interest in history.</li>

            <h2>England</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the last few years, my family and I have started going to England for our holidays.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>We usually go for city breaks, in cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and London.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>We have also visited theme parks while in England, such as Alton Towers, near Stoke.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>My brother and I also go to Premier League soccer games every year.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Since we support Spurs and Chelsea respectively, we try to get tickets for this match, though since it is a derby game, this isn't always possible.</li>
