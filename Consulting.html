            <h2>Autonomous Things (Robots)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>These are the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>These technologies all make extensive use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Examples of future implementations of these technologies would be self-driving cars.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Due to safety concerns of the potential negative impact of the new technology, they all require unprecedented levels of safety and security.</li>

            <h2>Immersive Experiences</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I first started playing rugby when I was 8 years old.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I played on and off with Mallow RFC throughout my childhood</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Rugby was perhaps my favourite sport to play, however it caused me to get injured quite a bit</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I don't follow professional rugby as much as I would with soccer and basketball, but I do try to watch the odd game</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I do follow the Irish National Team, especially during the Six Nations and World Cup.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Conor Murray is my favourite player, due to him being, in my opinion, the best scrum half in the world.</li>
