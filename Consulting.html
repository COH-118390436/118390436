            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Due to its design, blockchain is very resistant to modification of these records without the approval of everyone on its peer-to-peer network.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>The data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Blockchain was invented by a person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>The security and openness blockchain provides makes it perfect for use inn decentralised cryptocurrency.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Blockchain has also found use within the financial services industry, by implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Walmart and IBM are trialing the use of blockchain tracking and monitoring of Walmart's supply chin </ul>

            <h2>Autonomous Things (Robots)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>These are the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>These technologies all make extensive use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Examples of future implementations of these technologies would be self-driving cars.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Due to safety concerns of the potential negative impact of the new technology, they all require unprecedented levels of safety and security.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Another potential use of these technologies home robotics, caring for both the elderly and the young. </ul>
                    <br>

            <h2>Immersive Experiences</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>Immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>The most common form of this would be the use of virtual reality headsets, such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Another promising use of immersive experience is in psychiatric care, with medical professional able to visualize and better understand psychotic states of their patients</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Architects and building engineers are incorporating immersive experiences into their designs to better visualize the scale and depth of their buildings.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>One issue that solutions are being developed for is the prevalency of users who experience simulation sickness during use of immersive experience.</ul>
                    <br>
                </ol>
