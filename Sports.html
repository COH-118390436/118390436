            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <ol>
                <ul>I first developed an interest in sports when was just a toddler.</ul>
                <br>
                <ul>The two sports I'm most interested in are Soccer and Basketball.</ul>

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I first started playing soccer when I was 5 years old and haven't stopped since.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I've played with multiple clubs, such as Mallow United and Buttevant FC.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The team I support is Chelsea FC.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I try to go see at least 1 Chelsea match per season in England.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I also follow the Irish National Team as best as I can.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>James McClean would be my favourite Irish player, due to his tenacity and work ethic.</li>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I first started playing basketball when I was 10 years old.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I played Mallow Basketball Club until I was 16 years old.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I switched between goalkeeper and centre back as positions, as I would get bored playing in one position for too long</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I've recently started playing again, albeit on a casual basis.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I also follow the NBA quite a bit.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The team I support in the NBA is the Boston Celtics.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>My favourite player would be Kyrie Irving, as he is one of the best finishers at the rim, and is very exciting to watch.</li>

            <h2>Rugby</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I first started playing rugby when I was 8 years old.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I played on and off with Mallow RFC throughout my childhood</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Rugby was perhaps my favourite sport to play, however it caused me to get injured quite a bit</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I don't follow professional rugby as much as I would with soccer and basketball, but I do try to watch the odd game</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I do follow the Irish National Team, especially during the Six Nations and World Cup.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Conor Murray is my favourite player, due to him being, in my opinion, the best scrum half in the world.</li>
