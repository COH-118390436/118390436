            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <ol>
                <ul>I first developed an interest in sports when was just a toddler.</ul>
                <br>
                <ul>The two sports I'm most interested in are Soccer and Basketball.</ul>
                <hr></hr>
                <br>

        <div>
            <h2>Soccer</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>I first started playing soccer when I was 5 years old and haven't stopped since.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I've played with multiple clubs, such as Mallow United and Buttevant FC.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>The team I support is Chelsea FC.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I try to go see at least 1 Chelsea match per season in England.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I also follow the Irish National Team as best as I can.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>James McClean would be my favourite Irish player, due to his tenacity and work ethic.</ul>                 
                    <br>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>I first started playing basketball when I was 10 years old.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I played Mallow Basketball Club until I was 16 years old.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I switched between goalkeeper and centre back as positions, as I would get bored playing in one position for too long</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I've recently started playing again, albeit on a casual basis.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I also follow the NBA quite a bit.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>The team I support in the NBA is the Boston Celtics.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>My favourite player would be Kyrie Irving, as he is one of the best finishers at the rim, and is very exciting to watch.</ul>
                    <br>

            <h2>Rugby</h2>
                <ol>
                    <ul>I first started playing rugby when I was 8 years old.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I played on and off with Mallow RFC throughout my childhood</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Rugby was perhaps my favourite sport to play, however it caused me to get injured quite a bit</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I don't follow professional rugby as much as I would with soccer and basketball, but I do try to watch the odd game<ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I do follow the Irish National Team, especially during the Six Nations and World Cup.</ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Conor Murray is my favourite player, due to him being, in my opinion, the best scrum half in the world.</ul>
                    <br>
